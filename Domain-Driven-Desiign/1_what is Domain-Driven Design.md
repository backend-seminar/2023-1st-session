Why we have to understand domain
-
- The entire purpose of the software is to enhance a specific domain. To be able to do that, the software has to fit harmoniously with the domain it has been created for.
- The best way to do it is to make software a reflection of the domain, Software needs to incorporate the core concepts and elements of domain, and to precisely realize the relationships between them.
- Software which does not have its root planted deeply into domain will not react well to change over time.

What is domain
-
- A domain is something of this world. It can not just be taken into the code. We need to create abstraction of the domain.
- A domain model is not particular diagram. It is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey.
- The model is internal representation of target domain
- **A domain contains too much information to include it all into the model**
> we need to communicate the model.

Approachs to Software Design
-
- waterfall design method
  - The main problem is that there is no feedback from the analysts to business experts or from dev to the analysts
  - - It is really hard to create a complete model which covers all aspects of domain aspects of domain upfront
  - team member may so afraid of making design decision so there is no progress at all.
- Agile methodologies
  - employ a great deal of implementaton flexibility. and through iterative development with continuous business stakeholder participation and a lot of customer domain and can meet better produce software that meets needs.
  - continuous refactoring might leads to bad code.

Building Domain Knowledge
-
- We shokd start by understanding domain
- In order to be able to build up a model you need to extract essential information and generalize it.
- You need to learn as much as possible about domain from expert
- you and expert together will start to sketch a view of the domain, a domain model.
- The view is nether complete nor correct but It is where we should start. Try to figure out the essential concepts of domain.

> This might seem like a very time consuming process, and it is, but this is how it should be. because in the end the software's purpose is to solve business problem in a real life domain.
