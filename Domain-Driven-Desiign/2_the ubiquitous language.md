The Need for Common Language
-
- when we first build the model with others, there is fundamental communication barrier
- when we build the model, we must communicate to exchange ideas about the model, about the elements involved in the model, how we connect them, what is relevant and what is not.
- a project faces serious problem when team members do not share a common language for discussing the domain
- the most incisive expression of the domain often emerge in a transient form that is never captured in the code or even in writing.
- we definitely need to speak the same language when we meet to talk about the model and to define it.

Ubiquitous Language
-
- use the model as the backbone of a language which is called the Ubiquitous Language.
- Ubiquitous Language connects all the parts of the design and create the premise for the design team to function well.
- Language do not appear overnight. It takes hard work and a lot of focus to make sure the the key elements of the language are brought to light.
- The model and the language are strongly interconnected with on another. A change in model should become a change to the language.
- Domain expert should object to terms or structure that are awkward ot inadequate to convey domain understanding. If domain expert cannot understand something in the model, then something might be going wrong in the model or the language.
- Developers should watch for ambiguity or inconsistency that will tend to appear in design.

How To Design Model
-
- It might be temping to try to create one large diagram over th entire model. However, most of the time such diagram are almost impossible to put together. And furthermore, even if you do succeed in making the unified diagram, it will be so cluttered that it will not convey the understanding better then did the collection of small diagrams.
- Sometimes Well written actual code can be very communicative
